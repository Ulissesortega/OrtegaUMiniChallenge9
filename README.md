Reviewer Comments: The Program runs smoothly, it loops well and there are no unexpected errors. its easy to read and flow. i love the mediterranian options! the only small change that might improve it is getting rid of the console.readline after the 1 - A.F. 2- J.F. and the 3 M.F. it might flow slightly better but im just being nit picky! excellent code good job!!!
